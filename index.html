        <div class="about-content">
          <p> In 2021 I graduated from the University of East Anglia (UEA) with a degree in History 
            and achieved a 2:1. I am also currently enrolled in a web-development bootcamp and therefore I am looking for an appropriate entry-level role that 
            suits my skills. Throughout previous employment, volunteering and my degree I have 
            developed key skills to help me excel under a variety of situations. I have shown an 
            aptitude to work well under pressure, highlighted by my ability to perform well during 
            busy retail periods. Additionally, I am a very social person and developed good working 
            relationships whilst also developing excellent communication skills with customers and 
            key stakeholders. I am looking for a challenging, yet rewarding, work environment with 
            lots to do. I am also looking for a workplace in which I have the ability to thrive and 
            develop personally with the skills I have acquired through previous employment and my 
            degree. Additionally, I believe that skills learnt throughout the web-development bootcamp will give me keyskills required for work in this sector.
