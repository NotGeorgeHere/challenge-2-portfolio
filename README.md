# George Ryder - Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio for employers to access to show my skillset and suitability for jobs. I built this project for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is vital to have a portfolio as a web developer as you are able to show off projects you have worked on alongside giving people an easy way to view who you are and what you'd contribute to a working environment. Secondly, I built this project as I knew it would help me learn a lot. This is the first project that I have compelted from scratch and therefore I was able to learn a lot and teach myself by working through the project. By completing this project I also solve a major problem that I have faced which is the presence to get noticed by recruiters. Previously, I have had to submit CV's and cover letters for jobs I apply for but now, since completing a portofolio, I have another method in which I can either apply for jobs, or be head-hunted for a role as they are able to view projects I work on. I learnt a lot throughout this project. A major challenge I faced before working on this project was my understanding of flexbox and grid; particularly the former. By having to implement these in my project I learnt a great deal on how these layout systems work. I was also able to teach myself how to experiment within the inspector on web-browsers to see how different flex/grid layouts would look and how this would impact upon my portfolio. As it stands, the project items in the grid are placeholders. As personal projects are completed, the placeholders can be easily replaced. Also due to the design of the grid within this project, it is easy to add extra projects beyond the 5 that are currently on the portfolio website.
